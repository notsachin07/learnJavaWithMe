## 💡 Phase 5 Tips

1. **Multithreading requires careful thinking** - Race conditions are hard to debug
2. **Always close database connections** - Resource leaks cause major issues
3. **Design patterns are tools, not rules** - Use them when they simplify code
4. **Write tests as you code** - Not just after you're "done"
5. **Learn one build tool well** - Maven is more common, Gradle is more flexible

## 🏆 Phase 5 Challenge

After completing all classes, build a **Task Management System** that:
- Uses multithreading for background task processing
- Stores tasks in an embedded database (H2 or SQLite)
- Implements at least 3 design patterns
- Has comprehensive unit test coverage
- Builds and packages with Maven or Gradle
