Congratulations on completing all 5 classes in Phase 2! 🎊

---

## ✅ Completed: Class 1 - Loops

You've learned:
- ✅ `for` loops for fixed iterations
- ✅ `while` loops for condition-based iteration
- ✅ `do-while` loops for run-then-check
- ✅ `break` to exit loops early
- ✅ `continue` to skip iterations
- ✅ Nested loops for patterns and tables
- ✅ Common loop patterns (sum, factorial, prime check)

---

## ✅ Completed: Class 2 - Methods

You've learned:
- ✅ Method definition and calling
- ✅ Void methods (no return value)
- ✅ Methods with parameters
- ✅ Methods with return values
- ✅ Method overloading
- ✅ Variable scope (local, block, class level)
- ✅ Best practices for writing methods

---

## ✅ Completed: Class 3 - Arrays

You've learned:

## 💡 Tips for Phase 2

1. **Master loops first** - They're used constantly in programming
2. **Understand scope** - Where variables exist and don't exist
3. **Write reusable code** - Methods help avoid repetition
4. **Practice patterns** - Nested loops unlock many possibilities
5. **Debug systematically** - Read errors carefully, use print statements

---

## 🎓 What You'll Build After Phase 2

✅ **Programs that:**
- Process data repeatedly
- Use organized, reusable methods
- Store and manipulate collections
- Handle errors gracefully
- Follow best practices

✅ **Real-world applications:**
- Data processing scripts
- Menu-driven applications
- Simple games (with loops!)
- Grade calculators
- Pattern generators
- Search algorithms
