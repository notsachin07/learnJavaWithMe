## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Type everything yourself** - Don't copy-paste. Type each character to build muscle memory.

2. **Run every example** - Theory + Practice = Learning

3. **Experiment** - Change values, add features, break things intentionally.

4. **Debug errors** - Read error messages carefully. They usually tell you what's wrong.

5. **Ask "Why"** - Don't just memorize syntax. Understand the purpose.

6. **Build projects** - Combine concepts to create something useful.

7. **Review regularly** - Revisit earlier classes to solidify understanding.

## 📞 Quick Reference

### **Common Patterns You Should Know**

**Reading integer from user:**
```java
System.out.print("Enter age: ");
int age = input.nextInt();
```

**Checking if number is even:**
```java
if (number % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Even");
}
```

**Checking age eligibility:**
```java
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("Eligible");
}
```

**Using ternary for simple choice:**
```java
String status = (score > 50) ? "Pass" : "Fail";
```
