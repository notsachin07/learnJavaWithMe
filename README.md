## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher installed
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

### Running the Examples

```bash
# Navigate to any class folder
cd Phase-1-Fundamentals/Class1-HelloWorld

# Compile the Java file
javac Main.java

# Run the program
java Main
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

> 💭 **"The only way to learn programming is by writing code."**

- 📖 Read the README tutorials carefully before looking at code
- ✍️ Type out the examples yourself - don't just copy/paste
- 🧪 Experiment by modifying the code and observing results
- 📝 Complete ALL exercises, starting with Easy ones
- 🔁 Review previous topics if you get stuck
- ❓ Open an issue if something is unclear
